Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/a836698b68ba2b962069a761cd09d486fd82400c" target="_blank">a836698</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p><strong>A few key changes to the pipeline since last time we looked at these results:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>List of traits of interest changed to exclude dietary traits and add binary traits (among a few other minor revisions), total number of traits went down.</li>
<li>Sample changed to ensure both males and females were not related (previously had only removed unrelated within males and females separately), our resulting samples closely matched Neale round 2 GWAS which resulted in much fewer couples (~50K instead of ~65K).</li>
<li>Filtered SNPs for evidence of reverse causality (should not have any bearing on these results since these involve only one trait).</li>
<li>Meta-analyses are performed at SNP-level rather than MR-level.</li>

<li>The number of analyses corresponds to the number of traits (110).</li>
<li>The significant results after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing are shown below.</li>
<li><code>IVW_meta_beta</code> and <code>IVW_meta_pval</code> corresponds to the beta and p-value of the meta-analyzed MR across sexes, respectively (i.e. MR estimates were computed in each sex-seperately using sex-specific SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome results and then meta-analyzed).<br /></li>
<li>After adjusting for multiple tests (p &lt; <code>0.05/62</code>), identified 60 significant assortative mating MR results (corresponding to the table below).</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Binned results.</h3>
<ul>
<li>For each AM MR (<span class="math">\(X_{p} \sim X_i\)</span>), analyses were run in the full sample as well as in 5 roughly equal sized bins according to time couple had been together (<code>time_together_even_bins</code>) estimated using <a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=699">time at household variable</a>, and median age (<code>age_even_bins</code>).</li>
<li>Of the 60 significant results shown above, we tested to see if there was any significant difference in AM MR estimates amongst the two grouping variables.</li>
<li>Specifically, the outcome data set was split into 5 bins, and the SNP-outcome effect was estimated in each bin separately (and each sex seperately).</li>
<li>These outcome-SNP effects were then used to generate bin-specific MR estimates, using the same SNP-exposure effects from Neale.</li>
<li>To estimate the difference among bins, we used two approaches:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Cochran's Q test to test for heterogeneity in meta-analyses <em>(of which we obtained no significant results, so not presenting in paper)</em>.</li>
<li>Tested the significance of the slope of linear model of median bin (either <code>age</code> or <code>time together</code>) versus the bin-specific MR estimate.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Slopes were calculated by estimating the beta-coefficient of a linear regression between MR estimate within each bin (dependent variable) and median bin (independent variable, either age or time at same household). Linear models were run both <em>unweighted</em> and <em>weighted</em> for the by the inverse of the SE of the MR estimate.</p>
<p>The number of significant trends (<span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> estimates from the model: <span class="math">\(\alpha_{bin} \sim median_{bin}\)</span>) significant after multiple hypothesis testing (p &lt; <code>0.05/28 = 0.0017857</code>) in each group was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binned by median <em>age</em> of couples, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, significantly different between sexes: 4</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, significantly different between sexes: 4</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Binned by <em>time</em> couple had been together, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, significantly different between sexes: 0.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, significantly different between sexes: 0</li>

<ul>
<li>From the same-trait analyses we unforutantely are not left with many significant results after adjusting for multiple tests.</li>
<li>The plot comparing male to female estimates does seem to be an effect of regression dilution bias, since the inverse plot suggests the inverse conclusion? Am I interpretting this right?</li>
<li>Our most significant results are the binned results by age, where we have 4 traits that show significant differences according to the slope (the result is the same regardless of using the weighted or unweighted beta estimates), but none of the joint results are BF significant. The four traits are: Leg predicted mass (right), Arm fat-free mass (right), Trunk fat-free mass, Trunk predicted mass.</li>
