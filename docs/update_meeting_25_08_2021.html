Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/f7fc22e94c733d01f49d18e458b3b12b0507d5d7" target="_blank">f7fc22e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>However in this case, it may be more sensible to only consider same traits (i.e. testing for more of an &quot;assortative mating&quot; effect), reducing the number of tests to <code>131</code>. However, none pass BF-significance (p &lt; <code>0.05/131 = 0.0003817</code>). The most significant results is <code>lifetime number of sexual partners</code>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Binned heterogeneity</h3>
<p>For each proxyMR (<span class="math">\(Y_{p} \sim X_i\)</span>), MR analyses were run in the full sample as well as in 5 roughly equal sized bins according to <code>time_together</code> and <code>age</code>. Specifically, the outcome data set was split into 5 bins, and the SNP-outcome effect was estimated in each bin separately. These outcome-SNP effects were then used to generate bin-specific MR estimates, using the same SNP-exposure effects from Neale.</p>
<p>To estimate the difference among bins, used two approaches:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Cochran's Q test to test for heterogeneity in meta-analyses.</li>
<li>Tested the significance of the slope of linear model of median bin (either <code>age</code> or <code>time together</code>) versus the bin-specific MR estimate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two results are shown below, restricted to only same_traits. Note that each statistic was computed in each sex separately and meta-analyzed.</p>

<p>To complete all MR anlayses in the DAG above, needed to generate same-person MR estimates (i.e. standard MR). These were also run sex-specific, using Neale summary statistics. As expected, there are many BF-significant summary MR results. Significance was determined based on the meta-analyzed result across sexes. Thus the number of tests was equal to: <code>131^2 - 131 = 17030 (number of traits =</code>131`). The BF-significant results can be seen below.</p>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
