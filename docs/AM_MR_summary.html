Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/978309bbd441deb20efbf96114baa3ea2102aa13" target="_blank">978309b</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p>For certain analyses it is worth only looking at MR results between couples where the exposure trait is the same as the outcome trait. We've called these analyses <em>assortative mating MR (AM MR)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>A note on multiple testing adjustment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustment was based on PCs of correlation matrix.<br /></li>
<li>Calculate correlation matrix of all 118 traits tested.</li>
<li>Perform PCs on the resulting corr matrix.</li>
<li>Number of tests = # of PCs needed until variance explained is &gt; 99.5%.</li>
<li>Resulting # of effective tests: 66.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Binned results</h2>
<ul>
<li>For each AM MR (<span class="math">\(X_{p} \sim X_i\)</span>), analyses were run in the full sample as well as in 5 roughly equal sized bins according to time couple had been together (<code>time_together_even_bins</code>) estimated using <a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=699">time at household variable</a>, and median age (<code>age_even_bins</code>).</li>
<li>Of the 64 significant results shown above, we tested to see if there was any significant difference in AM MR estimates amongst the two grouping variables.</li>
<li>Specifically, the outcome data set was split into 5 bins, and the SNP-outcome effect was estimated in each bin separately (and each sex seperately).</li>
<li>These outcome-SNP effects were then used to generate bin-specific MR estimates, using the same SNP-exposure effects from Neale.</li>
<li>To estimate the difference among bins, we used two approaches:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Cochran's Q test to test for heterogeneity in meta-analyses.</li>
<li>Tested the significance of the slope of linear model of median bin (either <code>age</code> or <code>time together</code>) versus the bin-specific MR estimate.<br /></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The two results are shown below.</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of significant q-statistics significant after multiple hypothesis testing (p &lt; <code>0.05/29 = 0.0017241</code>) in each group was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binned by median <em>age</em> of couples, number of significant results within meta = 1 and sex-specific = 1.</li>
<li>Binned by <em>time</em> couple had been together, number of significant results within meta = 0 and sex-specific = 0.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Trend across bins</h3>
<p>Slopes were calculated by estimating the beta-coefficient of a linear regression between MR estimate within each bin (dependent variable) and median bin (independent variable, either age or time at same household). Linear models were run both <em>unweighted</em> and <em>weighted</em> for the by the inverse of the SE of the MR estimate.</p>
<p>The number of significant trends (<span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> estimates from the model: <span class="math">\(\alpha_{bin} \sim median_{bin}\)</span>) significant after multiple hypothesis testing (p &lt; <code>0.05/29 = 0.0017241</code>) in each group was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binned by median <em>age</em> of couples, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> significantly different between sexes: 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Binned by <em>time</em> couple had been together, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
