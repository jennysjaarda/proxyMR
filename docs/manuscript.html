Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/95bef3a115cb30dc51a55a6386781a786568d75d" target="_blank">95bef3a</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<li>Restrict to only traits that have correlation significantly &gt; MR-estimate (41 traits have correlation &gt; MR_estimate).</li>
<li>For each of these traits, find the traits which have a causal effect on this trait (MR p-val &lt; 0.05/[number of effective tests]).</li>
<li>Calculate the correlation due to confounding as: <span class="math">\(C = (\alpha_{z\rightarrow x})^2 * \alpha_{z_i\rightarrow z_p}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Calculate the ratio of this correlation (<span class="math">\(C\)</span>) and the correlation of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> in partners (<span class="math">\(C/r_x\)</span>).</li>
<li>Remove any <code>potential_counders</code> with correlation with <code>trait_ID</code> &gt; 0.8.</li>
<li>For each <code>trait_ID</code> prune remaining <code>potential_counders</code> so that all have correlations &lt; 0.8, prioritized by their <code>corr_due_to_confounding_ratio</code>.</li>

<li>For each trait in the pipeline, we tested the causal effect within couples (i.e. the number of analyses corresponds to the number of traits (110)).</li>
<li>The significant results after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing are shown below.</li>
<li><code>IVW_meta_beta</code> and <code>IVW_meta_pval</code> corresponds to the beta and p-value of the meta-analyzed MR across sexes, respectively (i.e. MR estimates were computed in each sex-seperately using sex-specific SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome results and then meta-analyzed).<br /></li>
<li>After adjusting for multiple tests (p &lt; <code>0.05/62</code>), identified 60 significant assortative mating (same-trait) MR results (corresponding to the table below)..</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Binned results (exploring effect of age and time-together).</h2>
<ul>
<li>For each AM MR (<span class="math">\(X_{p} \sim X_i\)</span>), analyses were run in the full sample as well as in 5 roughly equal sized bins according to time couple had been together (<code>time_together_even_bins</code>) estimated using <a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=699">time at household variable</a>, and median age (<code>age_even_bins</code>).</li>
<li>Of the 60 significant results shown above, we tested to see if there was any significant difference in AM MR estimates amongst the two grouping variables.</li>
<li>Specifically, the outcome data set was split into 5 bins, and the SNP-outcome effect was estimated in each bin separately (and each sex seperately).</li>
<li>These outcome-SNP effects were then used to generate bin-specific MR estimates, using the same SNP-exposure effects from Neale.</li>
<li>To estimate the difference among bins, we used two approaches:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Cochran's Q test to test for heterogeneity in meta-analyses <em>(of which we obtained no significant results, so not presenting in paper)</em>.</li>
<li>Tested the significance of the slope of linear model of median bin (either <code>age</code> or <code>time together</code>) versus the bin-specific MR estimate.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Slopes were calculated by estimating the beta-coefficient of a linear regression between MR estimate within each bin (dependent variable) and median bin (independent variable, either age or time at same household). Linear models were run both <em>unweighted</em> and <em>weighted</em> for the by the inverse of the SE of the MR estimate.</p>
<p>The number of significant trends (<span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> estimates from the model: <span class="math">\(\alpha_{bin} \sim median_{bin}\)</span>) significant after multiple hypothesis testing (p &lt; <code>0.05/28 = 0.0017857</code>) in each group was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binned by median <em>age</em> of couples, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, significantly different between sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, significantly different between sexes: 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Binned by <em>time</em> couple had been together, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, significantly different between sexes: 0.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, significantly different between sexes: 0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Given that we have no significant results, how should we report these analyses?</p>

<li>In the single trait analysis, we also decided to investigate Cochran’s heterogeneity Q-stat to identify traits with high heterogeneity.</li>
<li>This would indicate that associations between the index genotype and partner’s phenotype may not only act indirectly through causal relationship between the traits, but some direct effect is present.</li>
<li>Ideally, for the majority of the traits, the heterogeneity would be low, confirming that (despite what Tenesa suggests) there are no direct index genome to partner phenome effects.</li>
<li>We tested heterogeneity statistics using the function <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/reference/mr_heterogeneity.html">mr_heterogeneity</a> from the <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/index.html">TwoSampleMR</a> package.</li>

<p><em>A note on the number of traits:</em></p>
<p>We tested the impact of <code>trait_interest</code> on couple correlation amongst all traits in our couple MR framework (number of traits = 110) with the exception of home location and birth place coordinates (2 each [N and E] * 2), we also removed the trait itself from the confounder analysis where applicable (in the case of traits <code>20016_irnt</code>, <code>738</code> and <code>845</code>). [Trait <code>189_irnt</code> was not included in our final couple MR analysis but could still be evaluated here because no MR-estimates were used.]</p>

<p>We considered the regression of the following estimates vs <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> with an intercept passing through the origin (i.e. <span class="math">\(estimate \sim \omega + 0\)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(\rho\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> + <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\rho_{resid} + \gamma\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> is residualized for <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> (i.e. <span class="math">\(\rho_{resid} = resid(lm(\rho \sim \gamma))\)</span>)</li>
