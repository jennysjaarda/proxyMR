Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/62bc72547995d7e8eb5f12cdead58ebfb8b4be5a" target="_blank">62bc725</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Search for potential confounders to explain cases where correlation &gt; MR estimate.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Restrict to only traits that have correlation significantly &gt; MR-estimate (41 traits have correlation &gt; MR_estimate).</li>
<li>For each of these traits, find the traits which have a causal effect on this trait (MR p-val &lt; 0.05/[number of effective tests]).</li>
<li>Calculate the correlation due to confounding as: <span class="math">\(C = (\alpha_{z\rightarrow x})^2 * \alpha_{z_i\rightarrow z_p}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Calculate the ratio of this correlation (<span class="math">\(C\)</span>) and the correlation of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> in partners (<span class="math">\(C/r_x\)</span>).</li>
</ol>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Effect of sex, age and time together on causal effects in couples.</h1>
<ul>
<li>For each trait in the pipeline, we tested the causal effect within couples (i.e. the number of analyses corresponds to the number of traits (110)).</li>
<li>The significant results after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing are shown below.</li>
<li><code>IVW_meta_beta</code> and <code>IVW_meta_pval</code> corresponds to the beta and p-value of the meta-analyzed MR across sexes, respectively (i.e. MR estimates were computed in each sex-seperately using sex-specific SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome results and then meta-analyzed).<br /></li>
<li>After adjusting for multiple tests (p &lt; <code>0.05/62</code>), identified 60 significant assortative mating (same-trait) MR results (corresponding to the table below)..</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Binned results (exploring effect of age and time-together).</h2>
<ul>
<li>For each AM MR (<span class="math">\(X_{p} \sim X_i\)</span>), analyses were run in the full sample as well as in 5 roughly equal sized bins according to time couple had been together (<code>time_together_even_bins</code>) estimated using <a href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=699">time at household variable</a>, and median age (<code>age_even_bins</code>).</li>
<li>Of the 60 significant results shown above, we tested to see if there was any significant difference in AM MR estimates amongst the two grouping variables.</li>
<li>Specifically, the outcome data set was split into 5 bins, and the SNP-outcome effect was estimated in each bin separately (and each sex seperately).</li>
<li>These outcome-SNP effects were then used to generate bin-specific MR estimates, using the same SNP-exposure effects from Neale.</li>
<li>To estimate the difference among bins, we used two approaches:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Cochran's Q test to test for heterogeneity in meta-analyses <em>(of which we obtained no significant results, so not presenting in paper)</em>.</li>
<li>Tested the significance of the slope of linear model of median bin (either <code>age</code> or <code>time together</code>) versus the bin-specific MR estimate.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Slopes were calculated by estimating the beta-coefficient of a linear regression between MR estimate within each bin (dependent variable) and median bin (independent variable, either age or time at same household). Linear models were run both <em>unweighted</em> and <em>weighted</em> for the by the inverse of the SE of the MR estimate.</p>
<p>The number of significant trends (<span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> estimates from the model: <span class="math">\(\alpha_{bin} \sim median_{bin}\)</span>) significant after multiple hypothesis testing (p &lt; <code>0.05/28 = 0.0017857</code>) in each group was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binned by median <em>age</em> of couples, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, significantly different between sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, significantly different between sexes: 0</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Binned by <em>time</em> couple had been together, number of significant results after adjusting for number of tests:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, meta-anlayzed across sexes: 0</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> unweighted, significantly different between sexes: 0.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> weighted by inverse of the SE, significantly different between sexes: 0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Given that we have no significant results, how should we report these analyses?</p>

<li>In the single trait analysis, we also decided to investigate Cochran’s heterogeneity Q-stat to identify traits with high heterogeneity.</li>
<li>This would indicate that associations between the index genotype and partner’s phenotype may not only act indirectly through causal relationship between the traits, but some direct effect is present.</li>
<li>Ideally, for the majority of the traits, the heterogeneity would be low, confirming that (despite what Tenesa suggests) there are no direct index genome to partner phenome effects.</li>
<li>We tested heterogeneity statistics using the function <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/reference/mr_heterogeneity.html">mr_heterogeneity</a> from the <a href="https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/index.html">TwoSampleMR</a> package.</li>

<p><em>A note on the number of traits:</em></p>
<p>We tested the impact of <code>trait_interest</code> on couple correlation amongst all traits in our couple MR framework (number of traits = 110) with the exception of home location and birth place coordinates (2 each [N and E] * 2), we also removed the trait itself from the confounder analysis where applicable (in the case of traits <code>20016_irnt</code>, <code>738</code> and <code>845</code>). [Trait <code>189_irnt</code> was not included in our final couple MR analysis but could still be evaluated here because no MR-estimates were used.]</p>

http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
