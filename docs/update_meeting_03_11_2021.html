Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/ba13acc44057151d338e84c07ba4b88ed1849baf" target="_blank">ba13acc</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<div id="progress-update" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Progress update</h1>
<p>Decided to run MVMR as follows: <span class="math">\(Y_p \sim X_i + Y_i + X_p\)</span>, using instruments for <span class="math">\({X_i, Y_i, X_p}\)</span>. In this MR, the coefficient for <span class="math">\(X_i\)</span> would represent the <strong>direct</strong> <span class="math">\(X_i \rightarrow Y_p\)</span> causal effect and hopefully this would be close to zero in most cases. Running simply the <span class="math">\(Y_p \sim X_i\)</span> MR (with only <span class="math">\(X_i\)</span> instruments), would give you the <span class="math">\(X_i \rightarrow Y_p\)</span> <strong>total</strong> effect. Then we can compare the direct and total effect results.</p>
<p>A summary of the MVMR results are below, filtered to only traits with <code>abs(correlation) &lt; 0.8</code>, and then BF significant with <span class="math">\(X_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The column <code>corr_traits</code> corresponds to the raw correlation between traits in the biobank. The columns <code>IVW_meta_beta</code> and <code>IVW_meta_pval</code> correspond to the meta-analyzed across sexes univariate results from the <span class="math">\(Y_p ~ X_i\)</span> MR. The subsequent columns correspond to the MVMR MR results.</p>
