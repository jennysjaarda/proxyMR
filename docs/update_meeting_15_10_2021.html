Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/617844991da00541b8458b89b713c95c9b6bf19f" target="_blank">6178449</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Sample definition issue.</h1>
<div id="update." class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Update.</h2>
<p>Noticed that the sample sizes we were working with were quite a bit larger than the Neale database. After a bit of digging, I think I figured out the main reason(s): it seems to be a result of the way we filtered related individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, because we’ve done all analyses in each sex separately, I also have performed the related filters in each sex separately. Meaning there is surely related individuals between sexes that remain (of course each individual couple has been filtered separately for their own relatedness).</li>
<li>Second, I am using a function to retain the maximal set of unrelated individuals which is relatively computation heavy and I believe that Neale would have simply filtered based on <code>used_in_pca_calculation</code> from the QC file, which results in &lt;&lt;N.</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume Neale also applied related filtering <em>before</em> PHESANT transformations, while I applied it after (I was thinking that if someone was performing an analysis on a subset of UKB, they would have unnecessarily lost individuals even though the two related individuals weren’t in their subgroup). The problem is, these differences result in slightly different phenotypes in some cases I’ve realized.</p>
<p>For example, phenotype 1050 (amount of time spent outside, hours) is converted by the PHESANT pipeline to an ordinal variable with only 3 categories because the upper categories are so small. Where to split the categories directly depends on the data, with the goal to have roughly equal sized groups. Anyways, in Neale it’s split in different place than in our data.</p>
<div id="discussion-points." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Discussion points.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should we apply the same filter as Neale to get roughly the same sample size and data (particularly for these categorical phenotypes)?
<ul>
<li>Regarding the category definitions: best to have something as similar as possible to Neale's, because the instrument selection is based on his summary stats, which used his definition. But if it is hard to replicate his definition, it's not a big problem, it is much more important that we move forward fast</li>
</ul></li>
<li>And/or is it a problem that there we would have related individuals across sexes?
<ul>
<li>For the relateds: unfortunately, they have to be excluded (male-female relatives too, not only same-sex relatives), because when we meta-analyse male-&gt;female and female-&gt;male results, we assume inependence in the estimates, which is not true if you don't exclude all relatives.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="update-2.0." class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Update 2.0.</h2>
<p>I was able to nearly mimic the sample size of the round 1 GWAS, but not the round 2 GWAS. In the blog post describing the <a href="http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2017/9/11/details-and-considerations-of-the-uk-biobank-gwas">first release</a>, it is mentioned that N = 337,199 individuals are used in the GWAS. I can nearly replicate this number exactly with my data by removing un consenting, non-white and only retaining those that were <code>used_in_pca_calculation</code> (from the genetic QC file). However in the <a href="http://www.nealelab.is/blog/2019/9/16/biomarkers-gwas-results">round 2 blog post</a>, the sample size increases to N = 361,194 individuals.</p>
<p>The details compairing the two samples are found on the <a href="https://github.com/Nealelab/UK_Biobank_GWAS/blob/master/README.md">github page</a>, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>imputed-v3 parameters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Used.in.pca.calculation filter (unrelated samples)</li>
<li>sex chromosome aneuploidy filter</li>
<li>Use provided PCs for European sample selection to determine British ancestry</li>
<li>Use 7 standard deviations away from the 1st 6 PCs</li>
<li>Further Filter to self-reported 'white-British' / 'Irish' / 'White'</li>
<li><strong>QCed sample count: 361194 samples</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>imputed-v2 parameters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Used.in.pca.calculation filter (unrelated samples)</li>
<li>sex chromosome aneuploidy filter</li>
<li>White.british.ancestry filter</li>
<li><strong>QCed sample count: 337199 samples</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div id="discussion-points.-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Discussion points.</h3>
<p>Our current filtering matches closely the v2 filtering. If we tried to mimic the v3 filtering, we could increase our sample size. What do we think about this discrepancy? And more importantly, the decrease in power due to smaller sample size (about 25K less than the v3 parameters)? <em>This is just to keep in mind, if we want to increase our sample in the future if some results are nearly significant - could try adjusting our inclusion criteria.</em></p>

<p>Decided best to also include all <span class="math">\(X\)</span> IVs in the model as well. MRMR model is: <span class="math">\(Y_p \sim Y_i + X_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>To ensure a set of independent SNPs, <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> IVs were clumped using at a threshold of <span class="math">\(r^2\)</span> &lt; 0.001 using the 1000 Genomes European data set. Clumping p-values for priorization of SNPs, were based on the Neale summary statistics with <span class="math">\(Y_i\)</span> in both sexes, ensuring the same set of SNPs were selected in the male and female models.</p>
<p>The results before and after adjustment are shown below:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> MVMR.</h2>
<p>For each <span class="math">\(X_i \rightarrow  Y_p\)</span> MR, we included relevant co-variates (Z's) in a MVMR framework in the <span class="math">\(X_p \rightarrow Y_p\)</span> MR. Z's were selected based on having BF significance in <strong>both</strong> of the MRs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(X \rightarrow  Z\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(Z \rightarrow  Y\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>After Z's were selected, they were further pruned based on phenotypic correlation (same as above). First, any Z with phenotypic correlation with <span class="math">\(X\)</span> or <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> &gt; 0.8 was removed. Second, beginning with the most significant <span class="math">\(Z_j\)</span> association with <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> (i.e. <span class="math">\(Z \rightarrow  Y\)</span>), all reamining Z's with phenoytpic correlation &gt; 0.8 were removed. This process was repeated until all remaining Z's had phenotypic correlation &lt; 0.8 with each other and <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>The resulting MVMR model is: <span class="math">\(Y \sim X + Z_1 + ... + Z_k\)</span> run in same individual (see figure).</p>

<p>Finally, IVs for all <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X\)</span> were clumped as above (using at a threshold of <span class="math">\(r^2\)</span> &lt; 0.001 using the 1000 Genomes European data set. Clumping p-values for priorization of SNPs, were based on the Neale summary statistics with <span class="math">\(X_i\)</span> in both sexes, ensuring the same set of SNPs were selected in the male and female models).</p>
<p>On average, the number of Z's to include was: <strong>18.8684211</strong>, which seems quite high.</p>
<p>See an example of Z's included for one trait pair below (first trait is exposure, second is outcome).</p>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;Time spend outdoors in summer&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1] &quot;Time spent watching television (TV)&quot;</code></pre>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using

http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
