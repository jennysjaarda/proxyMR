Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/75c0cf31eadabd46b5c6fc1ea4008e0733224805" target="_blank">75c0cf3</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p><strong>Phenotypes were selected according to the following scheme</strong></p>
<p><em>Note that as none of the filtering criteria apply any BF correction for the number of phenotypes, the order of the steps does not matter.</em></p>
<p>An overview of phenotype selection and exclusions can be seen <a href="assets/phenotype_selection.png">here</a>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> UKBB Phenotypes in internal database processed by PHESANT.</h1>
<p>All SGG phenotypes went internal processing according the PHESANT pipeline. Some traits were excluded for various reasons (genetic trait, insufficient sample size, etc.).</p>
<p>Number of traits initially = <strong>2996</strong>.</p>
<p>Traits included and their correlations amongst couples can be seen below.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Sufficient power for MR based on number of IVs.</h1>
<p>Phenotypes were excluded if the number of valid IV was &lt; 5. IVs were defined based on a p-value of p &lt; 0 in <code>both_sexes</code> after clumping (performed in PLINK with the options <code>--clump-kb 10000</code> and <code>--clump-r2 0.001</code> using the 1000 Genomes European samples as a reference).</p>
<p>Number remaining after filter = <strong>170</strong>.</p>
<p>The traits remaining after IV filtering can be seen below.</p>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
