Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/110f384825921753a8790bb24f7a2ee89cdc8417" target="_blank">110f384</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p><strong>Phenotypes were selected according to the following scheme</strong></p>
<p><em>Note that as none of the filtering criteria apply any BF correction for the number of phenotypes, the order of the steps does not matter.</em></p>
<p>An overview of phenotype selection and exclusions can be seen <a href="assets/phenotype_selection.png">here</a>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> UKBB Phenotypes in internal database processed by PHESANT.</h1>
<p>All SGG phenotypes went internal processing according the PHESANT pipeline. Some traits were excluded for various reasons (genetic trait, insufficient sample size, etc.).</p>
<p>Number of traits initially = <strong>3118</strong>.</p>
<p>Traits included and their correlations amongst couples can be seen below.</p>

http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
