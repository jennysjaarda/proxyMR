Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/a765adbc1cbaa1b07fc09fd266ae10fc5c63e75e" target="_blank">a765adb</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<p><strong>Phenotypes were selected according to the following scheme</strong></p>

<p>All SGG phenotypes went internal processing according the PHESANT pipeline. Some traits were excluded for various reasons (genetic trait, insufficient sample size, etc.).</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> No evidence of sex-heterogeneity among valid IVs.</h1>
<p>Using the sex-specific summary statistics, heterogeneity between sexes was calculated. IVs that showed significant evidence of heterogeneity between sexes were excluded (p &lt; 0.05/[number of IVs]). After filtering IVs with significant heterogeneity, phenotypes were filtered to again have IVs &lt; 5.</p>
<p>Number remaining after filter = <strong>179</strong>.</p>
<p>The traits remaining after sex-heterogeneity filtering can be seen below.</p>

<p>Lastly, we removed several duplicated and redundant phenotypes. Specifically, all left-side body traits (highly correlated with right-side) were removed and we also retained only one of the duplicated phenotypes for BMI and weight (retaining data fields 21001 and 21002, respectively). Additionally, all “qualifications” data was removed (corresponding to field 6138) due to the availability of finer-scale correlated variables, such as “age completed full time education” (data field 845).</p>
<p>Number remaining after filter = <strong>118</strong>.</p>
<p>The traits remaining after removing dietary traits can be seen below.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
