Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/48b6256f23b0f8799ebd6355ac8e8176e643f926" target="_blank">48b6256</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<div id="impact-of-geography." class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Impact of geography.</h2>
<p>Wanted to assess impact of geography on couple trait correlation. Investigated this by using both genetic PCs and birth coordinates.</p>
<div id="pc-impact." class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> PC impact.</h3>
<p>Tested the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>cor(PC_i,PC_p) for each PC (i.e. within couple PC correlation).</li>
<li>cor(X,PC) for all PCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I calculated the correlation due to counfounding as <code>cor(X,PC)^2*cor(PC_i,PC_p)</code> values, and plotted them against the raw <code>cor(X_i,X_p)</code> values.</p>
<p><img src="figure/update_meeting_25_10_2021.Rmd/PC_trait_plot-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The table below gives the data in the plot above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>outcome_description</code> corresponds to the trait.</li>
<li><code>trait_couple_corr</code> is the correlation of <code>outcome_description</code> in couples.</li>
<li><code>corr_due_to_confounding_all</code> corresponds to the formula: <code>cor(X,PC)^2*cor(PC_i,PC_p)</code>, summed across all PCs.</li>

<p>The table below gives the data in the plot above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>outcome_description</code> corresponds to the trait.</li>
<li><code>trait_couple_corr</code> is the correlation of <code>outcome_description</code> in couples.</li>
<li><code>corr_due_to_confounding_all</code> corresponds to the formula: <code>cor(X,PC)^2*cor(PC_i,PC_p)</code>, summed across both coorindates.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Exploring the difference between <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>.</h3>
<p>In general, <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> is significantly larger that <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>, meaning that <span class="math">\(X_i \rightarrow Y_p\)</span> favors paths where assortative mating is through <span class="math">\(X\)</span> rather than <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>. This makes a lot of biological and intuitive sense. In other words, exposures are passed from index to partner, rather than outcomes.</p>
<p>A summary of the linear model of <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> vs <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>, forced through the intercept, is below.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the corresponding SEs on <span class="math">\(Y_{resid}\)</span>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for cases of reverse causation in the same-person MR.</li>
<li>Remove SNPs were the effect is significantly larger on the outcome than the exposure.</li>
<li>In the results including both sexes, meta-analyze at the SNP-level rather than the MR level (note that right now the two horizontal, same person MRs in the DAG above are different because they are sex specific.

<li>Calculate the variance of <span class="math">\(\rho + \gamma\)</span> as: <span class="math">\(2 * cor(\rho, \gamma) * SE_{\gamma} * SE{\rho}\)</span>, i.e. include the extra-term of 2*correlation.</li>
