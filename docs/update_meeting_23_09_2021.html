Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/jennysjaarda/proxyMR/tree/fd45d13628dbf630f6bade534f2c55641c136148" target="_blank">fd45d13</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Overlap between IVs for <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>.</h2>
<p>Is simply calculating the SNP overlap good enough? Better to calculate signal overlap using LD at some <span class="math">\(r^2\)</span> cutoff (what threshold would be useful?).</p>
<ul>
<li>For each IV used to estimate the causal effect <span class="math">\(Y_i \rightarrow Y_p\)</span>,</li>
<li>Test if they are in LD with any IV used to estimate the causal effect <span class="math">\(X_i \rightarrow X_p\)</span> at <span class="math">\(r^2\)</span> &gt; <code>0.9</code>,</li>
<li>Repeat for all IVs for <span class="math">\(Y_i\)</span> to calcualte the percentage overlap between the two sets of IVs.</li>
<li>Define percentage overlap as: (# of <span class="math">\(Y_i\)</span> IVs are in LD with at least one <span class="math">\(X_i\)</span> IV at <span class="math">\(r^2\)</span> &gt; <code>0.9</code>) / (total number of <span class="math">\(Y_i\)</span> IVs used).</li>
</ul>
<p>The results can be seen below. The <code>YiXi_IV_exact_overlap</code> column indicates the percentage of <span class="math">\(Y_i\)</span> IVs that are an exact match with <span class="math">\(X_i\)</span> IVs (same <code>rs#</code>). The <code>YiXi_IV_sig_overlap</code> column denotes the proportion overlap of signals, as defined above.</p>

<p>We can compare the <span class="math">\(\alpha_{y_{i}\rightarrow y_{p}}\)</span> before and after adjustment, and clearly see a band of estimates centered around <span class="math">\(y = 0\)</span>, which matches nearly perfectly the instances where <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> IVs share more than 50% of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> IVs.
